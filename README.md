# FrameFreeze

FrameFreeze is a Python-based tool that helps manage and optimize graphical renderings on Windows to prevent lag and improve gaming experiences. By adjusting settings such as VSync, fullscreen optimizations, and GPU preferences, FrameFreeze aims to enhance the performance of your games.

## Features

- **Toggle VSync**: Enable or disable VSync to prevent screen tearing.
